# pp (Alfred workflow)

This is an Alfred workflow for a quick access to personal homepages of CS
teachers from Paris Diderot University.

## Usage

Type `pp` followed by your query. The first time, you'll have to wait a little
to have your local people database populated.

To re-populate the database, use `pp > init`.

## Install

You need to have the [powerpack][].

Download the latest `.alfredworkflow` file from the [releases page][releases]
and open it with Alfred.
